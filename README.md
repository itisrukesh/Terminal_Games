# Terminal_Games
Basic Terminal or Kernal games build for my PG 1st year project in python language.

TerminalGames.py : This file is the Main File of the project which has all the games in it. You can run this file just by simply copy pasting the codes to your workspace or editor platform.

Other files are defined by the name of the game. For example: TicTacToe.py has the TicTacToe game code in it!.

Hope you like this project. 
Play it....! 🤩😁
